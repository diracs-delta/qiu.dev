# techstack

This page contains a list of all the technologies I've used for past projects. They're roughly ordered in terms of experience; I primarily use the technologies listed first.

This page is a work-in-progress. I might add other sections later.


## Programming languages

- TypeScript, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3, Python, Rust, C, C++


## Client-side (frontend) frameworks

- **SPA (Single Page Application)**: Quasar

- **PWA (Progressive Web Application)**: Quasar

- **SSR (Server-side Rendering)**: Quasar, NuxtJS

- **SSG (Static Site Generation)**: NuxtJS, Vuepress


## Server-side (backend) frameworks

- **node.js**: Express


## Testing frameworks

- Jest, Mocha


## Cloud infrastructures

- Amazon EC2, Netlify


## Vue.js libraries

I pretty much always use the Composition API for Vue, mainly for its better
type inference and code structure.

- **Component libraries**: Quasar built-ins, Vuetify

- **State management library**: Vuex (there's only one anyways...)

- **Content management system**: @nuxt/content, Vuepress


## JavaScript libraries

- **HTTP client**: Axios

- **SVG animation**: Anime, Paper.js

- **HTML5 canvas graphics**: Paper.js

- **TCP socket communication**: net (node.js built-in)

- **Websocket communication**: Socket.io


## Development tools

- **Bundlers/transpilers**: Webpack + Babel

- **Linters**: ESLint (preferably StandardJS preset)

- **CSS preprocessors**: Sass (preferably SCSS syntax)

- **CI/CD platforms**: CircleCI, Netlify, AWS CodeCommit

- **GitHub Apps**: Semantic Pull Requests

- **Package managers**: Yarn, NPM

- **Process managers**: PM2

- **Task automation**: nodemon, concurrently

- **Text editor**: VSCode and a dropdown Tmux terminal


## Technologies I want to learn later

- Gulp (debugging webpack loaders sucks, and I hope this is the answer)

- Pug or some other HTML preprocessor (XML is my mortal enemy)

- Octane, SunSpider, or some other performance benchmarker (what's the point of writing clean code if I don't get to prove it?)

- Selenium WebDriver (testing, webscrapers for data analysis, scripting my online orders) 

- Django, Flask, or some other Python backend (because JavaScript isn't exactly made to run numpy, pandas, or neural networks)

- Amazon Lambda or other serverless computing platform (easy pricing for my future web apps)
